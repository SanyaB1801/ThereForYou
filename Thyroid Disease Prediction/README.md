# Thyroid Disease Prediction

## Introduction
In this notebook, we will develop a machine learning model to predict thyroid disease using patient data. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Step 1: Load Data
We will start by loading the dataset containing features relevant to thyroid disease prediction.

## Step 2: Preprocess Data
Next, we will preprocess the data, including handling missing values, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and scaling the features.

## Step 3: Train Model
We will train a Random Forest classifier using the training data.

## Step 4: Evaluate Model
Finally, we will evaluate the model's performance using classification metrics and the ROC-AUC score.
